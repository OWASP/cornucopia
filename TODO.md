# Todo for MVP
An incomplete list of things that need to be done, in no particular order:

## Add mobile edition cards
Include the mobile edition cornucopia deck along with their explanation to the website

## Rework URL scheme for cards
Rework URL scheme from 'cornucopia.owasp.org/cards/AZ4' to 'cornucopia.owasp.org/AZ4

## Add CSS based card renderer
Create CSS based card renderer module instead of using images to display the cards. With this setup the cards displayed on the website will always be up to date with the relevant data. 
Update the card look to the official cornucopia card look

## News section
Create a couple of relevant OWASP Cornucopia 'News' items. (e.g. pictures of the OWASP Global AppSec - Lisbon - 2024 conference?)

## Visual update
Update/correct/finetune the visuals 

## Code cleanup
Cleanup some code because there is a bit of spaghetti going on at the moment
Cleanup the CSS styling so that styles/colors/backgrounds are global and can be changed for the entire site. This will also allow a dark mode or other theme in the future in case it's ever needed.

## Comment section
Current comment section underneath each card is tied to my old repository. Should we port over the comment section to the new MVP site? 

## Webshop
Create a page that lists all the possible places to purchase a deck of cornucopia playing cards. 

## How to play
Create a clean and concise how to play page.
