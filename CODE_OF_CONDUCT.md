## Sanctions

The Executive Director can suspend participation in OWASP for 30 days for perceived or actual breaches of the OWASP Code of Conduct or US law. Depending on the severity of the breach, the member or participant can accept the 30-day suspension, or in serious cases, the member or participant will be referred to the Compliance Committee for a decision regarding their ongoing participation or membership by the OWASP Board at the next available Board meeting.

**For first time Code of Conduct breaches, where no violation of US law has occurred:**

The member or participant can agree to comply with a temporary suspension imposed by the Executive Director of all OWASP participation for no more than 30 days. Membership will not be extended to cover the suspension.

**For repeat or serious breaches of the Code of Conduct, or where a participant
has been charged with a crime:**

The Executive Director must suspend the member, refer the matter to the Compliance Committee, who will make an independent evaluation on if the Board should strip leadership, revoke participation, or membership privileges. The period of suspension will remain in place until after the Board votes on the matter.

If the Board decides to take no action, full participation can resume immediately. If the participant is a member, their membership will be extended by the period of the suspension served.

### Transparency and Oversight

To provide transparency and oversight of sanctions, the Executive Director will inform the Board privately of the actions being taken under these sanctions, informing the Compliance Committee as required, and providing recommendations from the Compliance Committee to the Board and scheduling a vote as necessary.
