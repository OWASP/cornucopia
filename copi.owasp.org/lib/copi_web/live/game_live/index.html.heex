      <li>Players can click the button to join as a player</li>
      <li>Once at least 3 players have joined you can start the game (make sure all your players have joined!)</li>
      <li>Click the Start Game button and Copi will shuffle and deal out the cards</li>
      <li>Play starts with 3 of tampering</li>
      <li>To play a card, each player reads their card, announces the threat and records it by moving it to the board.</li>
      <li>Each round is won by the highest card played in the suit that was led, unless an Elevation of Privilege (EOP) card is played. In that case, the high value EOP card wins</li>
      <li>To win the round the players have to vote. The highest card that is voted on by 2 or more players takes the trick and wins the round, but every card that gets 2 or more votes get a point.</li>
      <li>Make sure people take notes on the threats and that you discuss what can be done to mitigate against these threats. Create tasks in you Issue Tracker Software and/or threat model!</li>

      <li>Once at least 3 players have joined you can start the game (make sure all your players have joined!)</li>
      <li>Before starting the game the players agree on a starting suit, i.e. a threat category.</li>
      <li>Click the Start Game button and Copi will shuffle and deal out the cards</li>
      <li>The first dealer is the player holding the lowest card in the starting suit.</li>
      <li>The dealer plays a card in the starting suit. Each other players has to follow the suit during that round. If that is not possible, the player can choose any card on hand.</li>
      <li>Each round is won by the highest card played in the suit that was led, unless an Access & Secrets card is played. In that case, the high value Access & Secrets card wins.</li>
      <li>To win the round the players have to vote. The highest card that is voted on by 2 or more players takes the trick and wins the round.</li>
      <li>In OWASP Cumulus standard rules only the highest card gets a point, but in the Copi version of the game, each card that is voted to be applicable by 2 or more players gets a point. The the player with the card that won the round gets an extra point.</li>
      <li>The player who wins the round, leads the next round (i.e., they play first), and thus define the next lead suit</li>

      <li>To begin, choose a player randomly who will play the first card or determine the first player based on who has the lowest card of Input risks - they can play any card from their hand except from the trump suit - Dataset Risk</li>

        <li>To begin, choose a player randomly who will play the first card - they can play any card from their hand except from the trump suit - Cornucopia</li>
        <li>Once a card is played, the player must read it out aloud, and explain how (or not) the threat could apply (the player gets a point for attacks that work, and the group thinks it is an actionable bug) - don’t try to think of mitigations at this stage, and don’t exclude a threat just because it is believed it is already mitigated - someone record the card on the score sheet</li>
        <li>If a player get stuck, ask them to click the "Need more info" links to access the card's help page and read the section called: "What can go wrong?"</li>
        <li>Each player must play a card in the same way; if you have any card of the matching lead suit you must play one of those, otherwise they can play a card from any other suit. Only a higher card of the same suit, or the highest card in the trump suit Cornucopia, wins the round</li>
        <li>To win the round the players have to vote. The highest card that is voted on by 2 or more players takes the trick and wins the round, but every card that gets 2 or more votes get a point.</li>
        <li>The player who wins the round, leads the next round (i.e., they play first), and thus define the next lead suit</li>

        <li>Repeat until all the cards are played</li>
        <li>Review all the applicable threats that scored points.</li>
        <li>If you are in doubt about how to mitigate a threat, use the "Need more info" links to access the card help page and read the section called: "What are we going to do about it?"</li>
