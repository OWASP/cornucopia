# Cornucopia talk OWASP chapter Belgium

On Thursday May 2nd we were invited to give a talk about Cornucopia at a meetup of the [OWASP Chapter Belgium](https://owasp.org/www-chapter-belgium/).

The agenda for the evening was as follows:
- 17h30-18h20: Welcome and refreshments
- 18h20-18h30: OWASP Update
- 18h30-19h30: Joris Gorinsek from NIKO: Navigating the Evolving Landscape of Cyber Security Legislation as an IoT Device Manufacturer
- 19:45-20h45: Ive Verstappen & Jef Meijvis from DotNET lab: OWASP Cornucopia and Scrum: A strategic approach to introduce threat modeling in an Agile development process
- 21:00: Close

[Ive](/author/ive-verstappen) and myself presented our experience and view on integrating Cornucopia in an agile scrum  development process. 

## Observations while playing Cornucopia
Over the last year we hosted quite a few Cornucopia sessions, during which we noted our observations.
A few key takeaway points:
### Timebox the session
Just as every scrum related meeting, it's really important to timebox the meeting.
This can be done by keeping the team that plays the game small enough.

### Cut discussions short
Don't let the Cornucopia session turn into a architectural or technical discussion.
Only discuss the cards and the threats, and move on to the next card once a threat is identified. 

### Limit the application scope
When the application being used to play the game becomes too big, it might be useful to limit yourself to a certain set of features instead of the entire application.

For those who would like to know more, the presentation can be downloaded at the bottom of the page.

Thanks to the organization of the Belgian OWASP Chapter for the great event!
