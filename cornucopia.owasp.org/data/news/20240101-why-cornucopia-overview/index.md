# Why Play Cornucopia?
Hello.  If you're interested in building secure applications, you're at the right place!  By playing cornucopia, you will quickly learn how to build more secure applications!  Playing Cornucopia together with your team mates will unlock the full potential of your AppSec program and you'll build software which is much more secure!

### Build secure applications in a fun way with real-life scenario's
Cornucopia is developed by cyber security specialist, so it provides real-world scenarios which you really want to defend against.  As developers, we are constantly working to make this information more accesible for development-teams of all levels.  And don't forget to have some fun while playing cornucopia!

### Learn about how to build more secure applications
We update this website constantly.  We work hard to make the information for each card as easy to understand as possible.  We are open for feedback and are constantly experimenting with new ways to improve the information we provide on this website.

### Check out our blog to learn more about Cornucopia
We are writing blogposts in which we explain several parts of cornucopia and how to build more secure applications.  Have questions?  Ask them here and we try to tackle your questions!

### Interactive mapping
The cards provide interactive links to several standards.  When possible, we make the links interactive.  We have implemented ASVS and CAPEC.  

We've also included the complete ASVS 4.0 standard on our website here: https://cornucopia.owasp.org/taxonomy/asvs-4.0.3

### buy a deck of cards now! (or two decks :-) )
Cornucopia is the fastest way to learn about building more secure applications.  Play the game together with your teammembers and get a whole new perspective on how to build more secure applications.
