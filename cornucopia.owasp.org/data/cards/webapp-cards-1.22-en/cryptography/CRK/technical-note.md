In general, all cryptographic routines should be on the server-side using robust, tested and protected routines.

NB: Unlike other cards in this suit, this CR K relates to an attacker being able to change the executing code. This may be due to inadequate source code control, deployment controls or server protection, but could also be modification of client-side code.
