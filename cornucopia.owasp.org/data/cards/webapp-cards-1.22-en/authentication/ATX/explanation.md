### Scenario: Pravinâ€™s Bypass of Decentralized Authentication Controls 
Envision a scenario where Pravin bypasses authentication controls due to the absence of a centralized, standardized authentication system. This situation arises because: 

1. **Lack of Centralized Authentication:** The system does not utilize a centralized module, framework, or service for authentication, leading to inconsistencies and vulnerabilities. 

2. **Dependence on Decentralized, Unproven Methods:** Different parts of the application use their own untested and potentially insecure methods for authentication. 

### Example: 

Pravin discovers that an online service uses different authentication mechanisms for its various modules. Instead of a uniform, centralized authentication system, each module has its own method, some of which are outdated or poorly implemented. Pravin targets the weakest module with rudimentary authentication checks, easily bypassing it to gain unauthorized access to the system. 

### Risks: 

This decentralized approach to authentication can lead to uneven security standards, making it easier for attackers to find and exploit the weakest link in the system. 

### Mitigation: 

- Implement a centralized, standard authentication module or service that is rigorously tested and approved for security. 
- Ensure this centralized system is consistently used across the entire application or network for all authentication processes. 
- Regularly review and update the centralized authentication system to keep it secure against evolving threats.
