Centralized session management routines are a good programming practice, but like other routines, developers need to understand how they work, how to use them and any limitations. These should preferably be the framework's in-built session management support. If third party session management libraries are used, it is important to test each routine before its implementation.

NB: This relates to what session management routines to use. See SM Q for application-wide coverage.
