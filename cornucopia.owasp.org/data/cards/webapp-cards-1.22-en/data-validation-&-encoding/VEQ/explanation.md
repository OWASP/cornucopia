### Scenario: Geoff’s Client-Side Injection 
Visualize a scenario where Geoff capitalizes on vulnerabilities in client-side data handling. He injects malicious data into a client or device side interpreter, exploiting several key oversights: 

1. **Non-use or Incorrect Implementation of Parameterized Interfaces:** The system either doesn’t use parameterized interfaces for data inputs or implements them incorrectly. 

2. **Improper Data Encoding for Context:** Data is not encoded correctly based on the context in which it is used. 

3. **Lack of Restrictive Policies on Code/Data Includes:** The system does not have strict policies governing the inclusion of code or data, allowing potentially harmful content. 

### Example: 

Geoff attacks by injecting a script into a web application that lacks proper encoding and parameterization in its data handling. For instance, he enters a script in a text field that is expected to only contain plain text. Since the application does not correctly encode this input for the HTML context, the script is executed when loaded in a user’s browser, leading to a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attack. 

### Risks: 

This type of vulnerability can lead to client-side attacks like XSS, compromising user data and browser security. 

### Mitigation: 

- Ensure the use of parameterized interfaces for all data inputs and correctly implement them. 
- Apply proper data encoding techniques based on the specific context of use. 
- Establish and enforce restrictive policies for code and data inclusion to prevent malicious content injection.
