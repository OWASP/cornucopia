### Scenario: Jeeâ€™s Encoding Bypass 
Picture a scenario where Jee, a clever adversary, bypasses your system's security by exploiting inconsistencies in encoding routines. This happens because: 

1. **Inconsistent Use of Encoding Routines:** Centralized encoding routines are not uniformly applied across the system. 

2. **Incorrect Encoding Choices:** The system uses wrong or inappropriate encoding methods for certain types of data. 

### Example: 

Jee finds that while your website correctly encodes data for HTML context, it fails to do so for JavaScript contexts. She inputs a string that is harmless in HTML but malicious in JavaScript, like a script tag with a JavaScript command. Since the system only encodes for HTML, it fails to neutralize the threat in the JavaScript context, leading to a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. 

### Risks: 

These gaps in encoding practices can lead to serious security vulnerabilities, such as XSS attacks, compromising both the system and its users. 

### Mitigation: 

- Ensure consistent application of centralized encoding routines across all parts of the system. 
- Use the correct encoding methods appropriate for each specific data context. 
- Regularly review and update encoding practices to cover all potential data handling scenarios.
