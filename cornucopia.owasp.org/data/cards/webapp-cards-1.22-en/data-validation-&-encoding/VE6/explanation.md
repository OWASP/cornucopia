### Scenario: Jasonâ€™s Validation Evasion 
Imagine a scenario where Jason, exploiting system weaknesses, bypasses security measures due to inconsistent application of centralized validation routines. He takes advantage of the system's oversight in the following way: 

1. **Inconsistent Application of Validation:** The system fails to use centralized validation routines on all input sources. 

### Example: 

Jason discovers that while most input fields on your web application are properly validated, certain API endpoints or secondary input forms lack the same rigorous validation. He targets these overlooked areas, submitting malicious data that would normally be caught and neutralized by the centralized validation routines. This allows him to inject harmful data or commands into the system. 

### Risks: 

Such lapses in validation can lead to severe security breaches, including data corruption, unauthorized access, and other forms of system compromise. 

### Mitigation: 

- Ensure that centralized validation routines are uniformly applied to all input sources, including web forms, APIs, and any other data entry points. 
- Regularly audit and update validation protocols to cover all potential avenues of data input.
