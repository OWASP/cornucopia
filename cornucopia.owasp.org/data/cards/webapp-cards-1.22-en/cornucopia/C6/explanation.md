### Scenario: Aaron’s Bypassing of Controls via Inadequate Error Handling 
Imagine a situation where Aaron exploits weaknesses in an application’s error or exception handling mechanisms. This vulnerability arises from: 

1. **Absence or Inconsistency in Error Handling:** The application lacks comprehensive error handling, or it is implemented inconsistently across different modules. 

2. **Non-Default Denial of Access on Error:** Errors do not automatically lead to the termination of access or execution. 

3. **Dependence on External Error Handling:** The application relies on other services or systems for its error management, creating gaps in control. 

### Example: 

Aaron targets a web application that has incomplete error handling routines. He induces errors in the application which, due to inadequate or inconsistent handling, expose sensitive information or system functionalities. Additionally, since errors do not default to denying access or terminating execution, Aaron uses these error states to bypass normal application controls. In some cases, the application relies on external systems to handle errors, and Aaron exploits the delay or miscommunication between these systems to gain unauthorized access. 

### Risks: 

Such vulnerabilities in error handling can lead to unauthorized access, exposure of sensitive information, and potentially allow attackers to manipulate application behavior. 

### Mitigation: 

- Develop and implement a comprehensive error and exception handling strategy that is consistently applied across the entire application. 
- Ensure that errors result in safe outcomes, such as terminating access or execution, to prevent exploitation. 
- Avoid relying solely on external systems for error handling; ensure that the application has robust internal mechanisms to deal with errors securely. 
- Regularly review and test error handling routines to identify and address any weaknesses or inconsistencies.
