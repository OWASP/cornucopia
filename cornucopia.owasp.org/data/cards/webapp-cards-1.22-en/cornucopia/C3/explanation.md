### Scenario: Andrew’s Access to Source Code and Business Logic 
Picture a scenario where Andrew gains access to an application’s source code or decompiles it, thereby understanding its business logic and uncovering any embedded secrets. This occurs due to: 

1. **Insecure Source Code Storage:** The source code is stored in locations that are not adequately secured. 

2. **Lack of Obfuscation in Compiled Code:** The compiled code of the application is easily decompiled, revealing the business logic. 

3. **Embedded Secrets in Code:** Sensitive information like passwords, encryption keys, or API keys is hard-coded into the application’s source code. 

### Example: 

Andrew targets a commercial software application used by many businesses. He accesses the application’s source code, which was inadvertently exposed in a publicly accessible repository. Andrew also decompiles the application’s executable files, which lack sufficient obfuscation, gaining a deep understanding of the application’s internal workings. He discovers embedded secrets, such as database credentials and API keys, within the source code, which he then exploits to gain unauthorized access to associated systems and data. 

### Risks: 

Such exposure of source code and business logic can lead to unauthorized access, intellectual property theft, and exploitation of hidden vulnerabilities or secrets within the application. 

### Mitigation: 

- Securely store source code in access-controlled repositories and limit distribution of compiled code. 
- Implement code obfuscation techniques to prevent easy decompilation and understanding of business logic in distributed binaries. 
- Avoid embedding secrets in the source code. Instead, use secure methods for managing and accessing credentials and keys. 
- Conduct regular security reviews and audits of source code management practices.
