### Scenario: Richard's Bypass of Incomplete Centralized Authorization Controls 
Imagine a situation where Richard bypasses an application’s security by exploiting the lack of comprehensive application of centralized authorization controls. This occurs because: 

1. **Selective Application of Authorization Controls:** The centralized authorization mechanism is not uniformly applied across all interactions within the application. 

2. **Oversight in Certain Interactions:** Specific actions or areas within the application lack the same level of authorization scrutiny that others have. 

### Example: 

Richard targets a corporate application that uses centralized authorization for main functionalities like accessing user profiles and dashboards. However, he notices that newer modules, such as a file-sharing feature, do not integrate these centralized controls as effectively. Richard exploits this gap to access and distribute sensitive files that he should not have access to, leveraging the less secure file-sharing module that bypasses the usual authorization checks. 

### Risks: 

Such inconsistencies in authorization control application can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive functionalities and data, posing a significant risk to the application’s security. 

### Mitigation: 

- Ensure that centralized authorization controls are consistently and comprehensively applied across all user interactions within the application, including all modules and features. 
- Conduct thorough security reviews, especially when integrating new features or updates, to ensure they adhere to established authorization standards. 
- Regularly audit and update authorization protocols to maintain a high level of security throughout the application.
