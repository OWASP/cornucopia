### Scenario: Keith’s Untraceable Actions in the Application 
Imagine a scenario where Keith can perform actions within an application, but it’s impossible to attribute these actions to him. This lack of traceability arises from: 

1. **Inadequate User Activity Logging:** The application does not maintain comprehensive logs of user activities. 

2. **Lack of User Identification in Actions:** Actions performed within the application are not linked to specific user identities. 

3. **Insufficient Audit Trails:** The system lacks robust audit trails that record detailed information about user actions. 

### Example: 

Keith exploits a financial application that lacks proper logging mechanisms. He conducts unauthorized transactions, but the system does not record detailed logs of user activities or link these actions to individual user accounts. Consequently, there’s no trace of Keith’s activities in the application’s logs, making it difficult to identify him as the perpetrator or to understand the sequence of actions he performed. 

### Risks: 

This vulnerability can lead to unauthorized actions going unnoticed, hinder incident response efforts, and impede accountability, potentially resulting in financial losses and security breaches. 

### Mitigation: 

- Implement comprehensive logging of all user activities within the application, capturing details such as timestamps, user IDs, and the nature of the actions. 
- Ensure that all actions are attributable to individual users by maintaining secure and unique user identification mechanisms. 
- Develop robust audit trails that provide a clear and detailed history of user actions for accountability and forensic analysis.
