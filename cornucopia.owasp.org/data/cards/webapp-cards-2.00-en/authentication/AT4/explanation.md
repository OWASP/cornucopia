### Scenario: Sebastienâ€™s Username Enumeration 
Visualize a scenario where Sebastien, using simple techniques, can easily identify or enumerate user names in a system. This can occur due to: 

1. **Predictable Usernames:** The system uses easily guessable or standard formats for usernames. 

2. **Informative Error Messages:** Error messages on login pages reveal whether a username exists or not. 

3. **User Enumeration through Other Features:** Features like 'Forgot Password' or 'Sign Up' inadvertently confirm the existence of specific usernames. 

### Example: 

Sebastien enumerates the usernames of a company by compiling a list of employees from publicly available sources such as LinkedIn. He then applies the general pattern " firstname.lastname'@'company.com " to generate potential email addresses, which are often used as usernames.  Setting the stage for further attacks like password guessing or phishing. 

### Risks: 

Such vulnerabilities can lead to targeted attacks, including phishing, social engineering, and brute-force attacks, as attackers gain knowledge about valid user accounts. 

### Mitigation: 

- Avoid using predictable username formats. Encourage or enforce more complex and less guessable usernames. 
- Design error messages to be non-revealing, providing the same response regardless of whether the username exists or not. 
- Implement measures to prevent enumeration through account-related features, ensuring they do not disclose information about the existence of usernames.
