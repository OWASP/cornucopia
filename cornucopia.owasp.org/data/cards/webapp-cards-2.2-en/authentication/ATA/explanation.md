## Scenario: Invent your own Authentication threat

Inventing an authentication threat can lead to:

1. **User Impersonation**: Attackers access other users’ accounts and perform actions as them.
2. **Unauthorized Privilege Access**: Exploit weak authentication to perform higher-privileged actions.
3. **Credential Theft**: Capture passwords, API keys, or session tokens.
4. **Bypassing Multi-Factor Authentication**: Circumventing 2FA or step-up authentication.
5. **Session Hijacking**: Exploit predictable or weak session tokens obtained during authentication.
6. **Account Enumeration**: Gain information about valid usernames or system structure.
7. **Denial of Service**: Flood login systems or trigger authentication failures to lock out users.
8. **Audit/Repudiation Issues**: Actions may be performed without proper identity attribution.

## Threat Modeling

### STRIDE

Any of the STRIDE categories may be applicable, but the primary concern is usually **Spoofing**.

Authentication’s main purpose is to verify identity. If you can invent a new way to bypass or manipulate authentication, the attacker can impersonate legitimate users. That’s the essence of a **Spoofing** threat.

### What can go wrong?

User impersonation, privilege escalation, credential theft, MFA bypass, session hijacking, account enumeration, denial of service, audit gaps.

### What are we going to do about it?

Strong centralized auth, MFA, secure credential storage, rate limiting, fail-secure defaults, session security, re-authentication, logging, testing, protection of auth routines.

1. **Use Strong, Centralized Authentication**: Standard frameworks, tested libraries, and MFA support.
2. **Enforce Multi-Factor Authentication**: Especially for high-privilege accounts or sensitive actions.
3. **Credential Protection**: Store hashed & salted passwords; protect secrets in transit and at rest.
4. **Account Lockout / Rate Limiting**: Prevent brute-force, dictionary, and credential-stuffing attacks.
5. **Fail Secure**: Deny access by default if authentication fails or system malfunctions.
6. **Session Management**: Secure session identifiers; rotate tokens after login or privilege change.
7. **Re-authentication**: Require identity verification for sensitive or privileged operations.
8. **Logging & Monitoring**: Log all authentication attempts and detect anomalies.
9. **Regular Testing & Review**: Penetration testing, fuzzing, and reviewing authentication flows.
10. **Protect Authentication Routines**:Prevent tampering with login code, libraries, and API endpoints.
