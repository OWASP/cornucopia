### Scenario: Sven's Temporary Password Misuse 
Envision a scenario where Sven capitalizes on the shortcomings in temporary password management. He exploits various system vulnerabilities: 

1. **No Mandatory Change on First Use:** Users are not required to change temporary passwords upon first login. 

2. **Excessive or No Expiry:** Temporary passwords remain valid for too long or don't have an expiration time. 

3. **Insecure Delivery Methods:** Temporary passwords are delivered through insecure channels, rather than more secure out-of-band methods like post, mobile apps, or SMS. 

### Example: 

Sven discovers that a companyâ€™s system issues temporary passwords to users which do not expire quickly and do not require a change upon first use. He intercepts or guesses these temporary passwords and gains access to user accounts, exploiting the extended period these passwords remain valid and the lack of a mandatory password reset on initial login. 

### Risks: 

This oversight can lead to unauthorized account access, data breaches, and potential exploitation of system vulnerabilities. 

### Mitigation: 

- Implement policies that require users to change their temporary passwords upon first login. 
- Set short expiration times for temporary passwords to minimize the risk window. 
- Use secure, out-of-band methods for delivering temporary passwords to ensure their confidentiality and integrity.
