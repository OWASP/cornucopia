## Scenario: Claudia's Access to Critical Functions

Imagine a situation where Claudia, exploiting insufficient authentication protocols, gains access to critical functions within a system. This occurs due to:

1. **Weak Authentication Standards:** The system lacks robust authentication methods, such as two-factor authentication (2FA), relying only on basic password entry.

2. **Absence of Re-authentication:** There's no requirement for users to re-authenticate or confirm their identity for accessing or performing sensitive or critical operations.

### Example

Claudia discovers that a corporate network only requires standard password authentication for accessing all areas, including sensitive financial records and administrative controls. By obtaining a user's password, Claudia is able to access these critical areas without any additional authentication checks. The absence of 2FA or re-authentication steps for high-risk actions leaves the network vulnerable to unauthorized access and potential data breaches or manipulation.

## Threat Modeling

### STRIDE

This scenario falls under STRIDE: **Spoofing**.

**Spoofing** is impersonating a user or system without rightful credentials.
Claudia uses weak authentication (password-only, no 2FA, no re-auth for critical functions) to impersonate legitimate users and gain access to high-value resources.
The issue isn’t that the data is leaked by accident (Information Disclosure) or modified directly (Tampering), but that the system cannot strongly verify identity, making spoofing trivial.

### What can go Wrong?

This vulnerability can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive functions and data, posing a significant risk to the organization’s security and integrity.

### What are you going to do about it?

- Implement strong authentication methods like 2FA for an added layer of security, particularly for critical functions.
- Introduce re-authentication processes for accessing sensitive areas or performing high-risk operations.
- Regularly review and update authentication protocols to ensure they align with the best practices and emerging security threats.
