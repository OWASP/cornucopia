The key concept for this card is inconsistent authentication. See AT J for missing authentication, AT K for changing the executing authentication code, and other cards in this suit for individual authentication issues (e.g. missing notification, inadequate password protection, enumeration, weak account management, weak use of temporary passwords, bypass, missing re-authetication, etc).
