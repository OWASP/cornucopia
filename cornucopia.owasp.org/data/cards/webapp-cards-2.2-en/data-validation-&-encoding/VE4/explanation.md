### Scenario: Daveâ€™s Contextual Manipulation 
Imagine a situation where Dave, exploiting a security loophole, inputs malicious field names or data. This occurs because the system fails to check these inputs within the context of the current user and process. Here's how he does it: 

1. **Malicious Field Names**: Dave submits field names that are either unrecognized or inappropriate for the current context. 

2. **Inappropriate Data Context**: The data entered by Dave is harmful or irrelevant in the specific context of the ongoing process or user's role. 

### Example: 

Dave attacks by altering a web form field. He changes a hidden field named 'user_role' from 'user' to 'admin'. The system, lacking proper contextual validation, mistakenly grants Dave administrative privileges based on this manipulated input, giving him access to sensitive areas of the system. 

### Risks: 

This form of attack can lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, and potentially full system compromise. 

### Mitigation: 

- Implement strict contextual validation for all data inputs, particularly focusing on user roles and process stages. 
- Continually update and refine validation mechanisms to address new and evolving security threats.
