### Scenario: Gabe’s Server-Side Interpreter Exploits 
Imagine a scenario where Gabe takes advantage of weaknesses in server-side data processing. He injects malicious data into server-side interpreters like SQL, OS commands, XPath, Server JavaScript, SMTP, etc. This occurs because: 

1. **Lack of Strongly Typed Parameterized Interfaces:** The system either doesn’t use strongly typed parameterized interfaces, or they are implemented incorrectly. 

### Example: 

Gabe targets a web application's database interaction. He enters a specially crafted input into a search field, such as ' OR '1'='1. Due to the lack of a strongly typed parameterized query interface, this input is directly included in a SQL query. This results in a SQL injection, where Gabe manipulates the query to return all records or even modify database contents. 

### Risks: 

Such vulnerabilities can lead to severe consequences, including unauthorized data access, manipulation of server-side operations, and potentially full system compromise. 

### Mitigation: 

- Implement and rigorously enforce the use of strongly typed parameterized interfaces for all server-side data processing. 
- Regularly review and test these implementations to ensure they handle data inputs securely and prevent injection attacks.
