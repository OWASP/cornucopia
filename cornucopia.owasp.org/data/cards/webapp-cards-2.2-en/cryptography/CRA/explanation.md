## Scenario: Invent your own Cryptography threat

Inventing a new cryptography threat could lead to:

1. **Data Exposure**: Breaking encryption or hashing reveals confidential data (passwords, PII, financial info).
2. **Impersonation / Spoofing**: Forging digital signatures, certificates, or tokens allows pretending to be another user/system.
3. **Data Tampering**: Altering messages, files, or communications without detection.
4. **Privilege Escalation**: Using broken cryptography in access tokens or authorization systems to gain higher privileges.
5. **Replay or Forgery**: Exploiting weak session keys or signed messages to repeat or fabricate transactions.
6. **Denial of Service**: Attacking computationally heavy cryptographic operations to exhaust system resources.
7. **Loss of Auditability / Repudiation**: Actions cannot be trusted as genuine if signatures or integrity checks are bypassed.

## Threat Modeling

### STRIDE

Any of the STRIDE categories may be applicable, but the primary concern is usually **Information Disclosure** or **Tampering** as breaking cryptography, in most cases, mean you can either disclose or modify data, depending on the context.

### What can go Wrong?

Data leaks, impersonation, tampering, privilege escalation, replay/forgery, DoS, loss of trust in audits.

### What are you going to do about it?

Use strong cryptography, proper key management, proven libraries, integrity checks, secure storage, monitoring, and regular updates.

1. **Use Strong, Approved Cryptography**: Only standardized, vetted algorithms (AES, RSA, ECDSA, SHA-2/3, etc.).
2. **Proper Key Management**: Secure generation, storage, rotation, and destruction of keys.
3. **Do Not Roll Your Own Cryptography**: Avoid custom encryption, hashing, or random number implementations.
4. **Use Proven Libraries**: Rely on well-maintained cryptographic libraries rather than ad-hoc code.
5. **Enforce Integrity Checks**: Always use authenticated encryption (AES-GCM, ChaCha20-Poly1305) or MACs to prevent tampering.
6. **Secure Transmission and Storage**: Encrypt sensitive data in transit and at rest.
7. **Monitor and Audit**: Log unusual cryptographic failures, expired certificates, or invalid signatures.
8. **Regularly Update Algorithms**: Replace algorithms that are weak due to advances in computing power or cryptanalysis.
9. **Penetration Testing and Threat Modeling**: Simulate novel cryptographic attacks and assess resistance.
