### Scenario: Romain's Access to Unencrypted Data in Memory and Transit 
Picture a scenario where Romain accesses and modifies unencrypted data, either in memory or in transit. This situation arises due to: 

1. **Unencrypted Data in Memory:** Sensitive data like cryptographic secrets, credentials, and session identifiers are stored unencrypted in system memory. 

2. **Data Exposed in Communication:** Personal and commercially-sensitive data is transmitted without encryption, either within the application or in interactions with external systems. 

### Example: 

Romain targets an application that handles sensitive user data but fails to encrypt this data while in use or during internal processing. He exploits this by accessing the applicationâ€™s memory, where he finds unencrypted credentials and session identifiers. Additionally, Romain intercepts data being transmitted between the application and external systems, such as payment gateways, as it is sent without proper encryption, allowing him to read and modify sensitive information during transit. 

### Risks: 

This vulnerability can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data, data breaches, and potential manipulation of critical information. 

### Mitigation: 

- Implement encryption for sensitive data while it is in memory and during processing within the application. 
- Ensure that all data communications, both internal and external, are secured with robust encryption methods. 
- Regularly review and update encryption practices to cover data in use, in transit, and during communications with external systems.
