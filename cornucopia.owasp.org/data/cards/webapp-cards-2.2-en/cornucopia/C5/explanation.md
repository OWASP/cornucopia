### Scenario: Larry's Manipulation of Trust in and Around the Application 
Envision a scenario where Larry influences or abuses the trust that other parties, including users, have in a particular application, or leverages that trust to manipulate other applications. This issue arises from: 

1. **Exploitation of Established Trust:** Larry takes advantage of the trust users or other applications have in the targeted application. 

2. **Cross-Application Trust Abuse:** He manipulates the trust relationship between applications to perform malicious actions. 

### Example: 

Larry targets a widely used communication platform that has earned a high level of trust from its users. He creates phishing messages that appear to come from this trusted application, exploiting users' trust to gather sensitive information like login credentials. Additionally, Larry leverages this application’s API, which is trusted by other applications, to gain unauthorized access or extract data from these interconnected systems. 

### Risks: 

Such manipulation can lead to significant breaches of user trust, unauthorized access to sensitive information, and exploitation of interconnected systems. 

### Mitigation: 

- Implement robust verification and authentication measures to prevent misuse of the application’s trusted status. 
- Educate users about the risks of phishing and other trust exploitation tactics. 
- Monitor and control how the application’s APIs and services interact with other systems, ensuring secure and verified connections. 
- Establish strict guidelines and security protocols for third-party applications or services that integrate with the application.
