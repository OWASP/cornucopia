## Scenario: Dinis’s Unauthorized Access to Security Configurations

Envision a scenario where Dinis, exploiting weak authorization mechanisms, gains access to sensitive security configuration information or access control lists (ACLs). This vulnerability arises from:

1. **Inadequate Protection of Security Settings:** Essential security configurations and ACLs are not sufficiently safeguarded against unauthorized access.

2. **Lack of Robust Authorization Checks:** The system fails to rigorously verify user permissions for accessing these critical settings.

### Example

Dinis discovers that a network management tool in an organization does not adequately restrict access to its security configuration settings and ACLs. Although he is a regular user, the tool’s weak authorization checks allow him to view and potentially alter these configurations. By accessing the ACLs, Dinis manipulates the permissions, granting himself higher access rights and enabling further exploitation of the system.

## Threat Modeling

### STRIDE

This scenario maps primarily to STRIDE: **Information Disclosure** and potentially **Elevation of Privilege**.

**Elevation of Privilege** (EoP) occurs when an attacker gains access to capabilities or resources beyond their intended permissions.
Dinis, a regular user, can access security configurations and ACLs, which are normally restricted and sensitive, meaning that there is a **Information Disclosure**. In the case that he can modify them, he can grant himself higher privileges, escalating his access.
The core issue is unauthorized access to sensitive security controls, potentially, enabling privilege escalation.

### What can go wrong?

Such vulnerabilities can lead to unauthorized alterations in security settings, potential system breaches, and the compromise of network integrity.

For more things that can go wrong, see the [Common Attack Patterns related to this card](#mapping 'Common Attack Patterns related to this card [internal]') in the table below.

### What are we going to do about it?

1. Implement stringent authorization controls to restrict access to security configurations and ACLs, ensuring only authorized personnel can view or modify them.
2. Regularly audit and monitor access to these settings to detect and respond to any unauthorized attempts.
3. Employ role-based access control (RBAC) to clearly define and enforce access permissions based on user roles
4. Restrict access to security-relevant configuration to only appropriate authorized users.
