A user's privileges may change during a session. If this information is also stored in session data, it will not reflect the changes. Consider forcing re-authentication. See Authentication [Authentication 9 (AT9)](/cards/AT9#card 'Authentication 9 (AT9) [internal]') for re-authentication requirements.
