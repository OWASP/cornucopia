### Scenario: Marce's Ability to Forge Requests 
Imagine a situation where Marce forges requests in a system that lacks adequate protections against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF). This happens because: 

1. **Absence of Anti-CSRF Tokens:** The application does not use strong, random tokens for each session or critical per-request actions. 

2. **State-Changing Actions Unprotected:** Actions that change state (like form submissions or settings changes) are not secured with unique tokens. 

### Example: 

Marce targets an online banking platform that does not implement anti-CSRF tokens for transactions. She crafts a malicious email with a hidden request embedded in an image source attribute. When an authenticated user unknowingly opens this email, the request is sent to the bankâ€™s server. Since the server cannot distinguish this forged request from a legitimate one, it processes the transaction as if it were a request made by the user, leading to unauthorized financial transfers. 

### Risks: 

Such vulnerabilities expose users to CSRF attacks, where attackers can manipulate users' actions without their knowledge, potentially leading to unauthorized state changes and data breaches. 

### Mitigation: 

- Implement strong, random anti-CSRF tokens for each session and for critical actions that change the system's state. 
- Ensure that every state-changing action requires a valid anti-CSRF token to proceed. 
- Regularly review and update security measures to protect against CSRF and other request forgery methods.
