## Scenario: William's Control Over Session Identifier Generation

Envision a scenario where William, exploiting a critical aspect of session management, gains control over the generation of session identifiers. He leverages this control to:

1. **Predictability in Session IDs:** By influencing session ID generation, William makes these identifiers predictable, allowing him to guess valid session IDs.

2. **Creation of Weak Session Identifiers:** He generates session identifiers that are not sufficiently random or complex, making them easier to compromise.

### Example

William infiltrates a web application's session management system. He manipulates the session ID generation algorithm to produce predictable IDs. For instance, he sets the IDs to increment sequentially. With this knowledge, William easily predicts and hijacks active sessions by guessing the next valid session ID, gaining unauthorized access to user accounts and sensitive data.

## Threat Modeling

### STRIDE

This scenario maps primarily to STRIDE: **Spoofing**.

**Spoofing** is about impersonating a legitimate user or system.
William manipulates session ID generation so he can predict valid session identifiers.
By doing this, he can assume the identity of another user without knowing their credentials.
The core threat is unauthorized impersonation, which is **Spoofing**.

### What can go wrong?

Control over session ID generation can lead to session hijacking, unauthorized access, and potential breaches of user privacy and data security.

For more things that can go wrong, see the [Common Attack Patterns related to this card](#mapping 'Common Attack Patterns related to this card [internal]') in the table below.

### What are you going to do about it?

In general use the server or frameworkâ€™s own session management controls, rather than creating custom code. The application should only recognize these session identifiers as valid, and the session identifier creation must always be done on a trusted system (e.g. server-side).

1. Ensure that session identifiers are generated using strong, cryptographically secure algorithms that produce random and complex IDs.
2. Regularly review and test the session ID generation process to ensure it remains robust against prediction and manipulation.
3. Implement additional security checks to detect and mitigate session hijacking attempts.
