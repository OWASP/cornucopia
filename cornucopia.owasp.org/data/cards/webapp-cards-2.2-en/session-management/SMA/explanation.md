## Scenario: Invent your own Session Management threat

Inventing a new session management attack could lead to:

1. **Session Hijacking / Impersonation**: Attacker takes over another userâ€™s active session.
2. **Session Fixation**: Attacker forces a victim to use a session ID they know.
3. **Privilege Escalation**: Attacker uses session manipulation to gain admin or sensitive access.
4. **Information Leakage**: Sensitive user data or tokens could be exposed.
5. **Replay / CSRF-like attacks**: Reusing a valid session to perform unauthorized actions.
6. **Service Disruption**: Exhausting session tables or server resources through massive session creation.
7. **Loss of Auditability**: Actions performed via hijacked or manipulated sessions may not be attributable.

## Threat modeling

### STRIDE

STRIDE categories affected, depends on the context. Potentially, all six may be affected (**Spoofing**, **Tampering**, **Repudiation**, **Information Disclosure**, **Elevation of Privilege**, **Denial of Service**).

### What can go wrong?

Hijacking, escalation, data leaks, denial of service, loss of auditability.

## What are you going to do about it?

Use strong session IDs, secure cookies, enforce timeouts, re-authentication, centralized session management, monitoring, and periodic testing.

Best Practices / Mitigations for Session Management threats would be:

1. **Strong Session Identifiers**: Use cryptographically random, long, and unpredictable session IDs.
2. **Secure Storage and Transmission**: Cookies: HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite and avoiding putting session IDs in URLs.
3. **Session Expiration**: Inactivity timeouts and absolute session lifetimes.
4. **Session Binding**: Bind sessions to IP addresses, devices, or user agents when feasible.
5. **Re-authentication for Critical Actions**: Ask users to log in again for sensitive operations.
6. **Invalidate Old Sessions**: After logout, password change, or role change.
7. **Monitor & Detect**: Detect concurrent sessions, unusual access patterns, or abnormal session behavior.
8. **Centralized Session Management**: Avoid custom implementations; use framework-standard, tested routines.
9. **Audit and Logging**: Log session creation, invalidation, and unusual activity.
10. **Periodic Security Testing**: Include fuzzing, stress tests, and penetration testing against session controls.
