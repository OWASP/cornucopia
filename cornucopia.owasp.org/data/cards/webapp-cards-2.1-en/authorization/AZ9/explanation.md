### Scenario: Mike’s Misuse of Application Features 
Envision a situation where Mike misuses an application by exploiting valid features in unintended ways. He leverages these features by: 

1. **Excessive Speed or Frequency:** Using a feature too quickly or too frequently, beyond its normal operational capacity. 

2. **Resource Consumption:** Utilizing features in a way that consumes excessive application resources. 

3. **Inducing Race Conditions:** Performing actions in a manner that causes race conditions, where the application's behavior becomes unpredictable due to timing issues. 

4. **Over-utilization of Features:** Exploiting a feature to an extent that it negatively impacts the application’s functionality or other users' experiences. 

### Example: 

Mike discovers that an online booking system allows rapid repeated bookings and cancellations without any rate limits. He writes a script that continuously books and cancels appointments, exploiting the system’s lack of controls on the frequency of use. This not only consumes significant server resources, leading to performance degradation, but also creates race conditions that result in double bookings and data inconsistencies. 

### Risks: 

Such misuse can lead to system overloads, degraded performance, unintended application behaviors, and negative impacts on other users. 

### Mitigation: 

- Implement rate limiting and usage throttling to prevent excessive use of features. 
- Design features with resource consumption and potential misuse in mind, ensuring they can handle unexpected or intensive usage without impacting overall system performance. 
- Regularly monitor application usage patterns to identify and address potential abuses or misuses of features.
