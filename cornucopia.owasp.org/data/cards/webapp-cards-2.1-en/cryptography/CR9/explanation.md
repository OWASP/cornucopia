### Scenario: Andy's Bypassing of Weak Custom Cryptographic Functions 
Consider a situation where Andy bypasses crucial cryptographic functions like random number generation, GUID generation, hashing, and encryption because they are self-built and inadequately secure. This issue arises from: 

1. **Self-Built Cryptographic Functions:** The application relies on custom-developed cryptographic functions, which may not meet industry security standards. 

2. **Weaknesses in Custom Algorithms:** These self-built functions are not as robust or tested as established cryptographic standards, making them vulnerable to exploitation. 

### Example: 

Andy targets a system that uses a custom-built encryption algorithm and a self-developed function for generating random numbers. He identifies weaknesses in these algorithms, such as predictable patterns in random number generation and flaws in the encryption process. Leveraging these vulnerabilities, Andy is able to predict supposedly random values and decrypt sensitive data, bypassing the intended security measures of the system. 

### Risks: 

Reliance on weak, custom-built cryptographic functions can lead to compromised data security, unauthorized access, and potential breaches of sensitive information. 

### Mitigation: 

- Replace custom cryptographic functions with well-established, industry-standard algorithms and libraries that have been rigorously tested and proven secure. 
- Conduct regular security audits and reviews of cryptographic implementations to ensure they are strong and effective. 
- Avoid developing in-house cryptographic solutions unless absolutely necessary and ensure they are developed by experts in cryptography.
