# CAPEC™ 674: Design for FPGA Maliciously Altered

## Description

{'p': {'__prefix': 'xhtml', '__text': 'An adversary alters the functionality of a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) by causing an FPGA configuration memory chip reload in order to introduce a malicious function that could result in the FPGA performing or enabling malicious functions on a host system. Prior to the memory chip reload, the adversary alters the program for the FPGA by adding a function to impact system operation.'}}
