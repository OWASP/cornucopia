# MASVS-CODE-3

## The app only uses software components without known vulnerabilities.

To be truly secure, a full whitebox assessment should have been performed on all app components. However, as it usually happens with e.g. for third-party components this is not always feasible and not typically part of a penetration test. This control covers "low-hanging fruit" cases, such as those that can be detected just by scanning libraries for known vulnerabilities.
