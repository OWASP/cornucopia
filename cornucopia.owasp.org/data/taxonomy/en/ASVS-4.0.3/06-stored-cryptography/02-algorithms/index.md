# Algorithms

## V6.2.1

Verify that all cryptographic modules fail securely, and errors are handled in a way that does not enable Padding Oracle attacks.

Level 1 required: True

Level 2 required: True

Level 3 required: True

CWE: [310](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/310)

## V6.2.2

Verify that industry proven or government approved cryptographic algorithms, modes, and libraries are used, instead of custom coded cryptography. ([C8](https://owasp.org/www-project-proactive-controls/#div-numbering))

Level 1 required: False

Level 2 required: True

Level 3 required: True

CWE: [327](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/327)

## V6.2.3

Verify that encryption initialization vector, cipher configuration, and block modes are configured securely using the latest advice.

Level 1 required: False

Level 2 required: True

Level 3 required: True

CWE: [326](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/326)

## V6.2.4

Verify that random number, encryption or hashing algorithms, key lengths, rounds, ciphers or modes, can be reconfigured, upgraded, or swapped at any time, to protect against cryptographic breaks. ([C8](https://owasp.org/www-project-proactive-controls/#div-numbering))

Level 1 required: False

Level 2 required: True

Level 3 required: True

CWE: [326](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/326)

## V6.2.5

Verify that known insecure block modes (i.e. ECB, etc.), padding modes (i.e. PKCS#1 v1.5, etc.), ciphers with small block sizes (i.e. Triple-DES, Blowfish, etc.), and weak hashing algorithms (i.e. MD5, SHA1, etc.) are not used unless required for backwards compatibility.

Level 1 required: False

Level 2 required: True

Level 3 required: True

CWE: [326](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/326)

## V6.2.6

Verify that nonces, initialization vectors, and other single use numbers must not be used more than once with a given encryption key. The method of generation must be appropriate for the algorithm being used.

Level 1 required: False

Level 2 required: True

Level 3 required: True

CWE: [326](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/326)

## V6.2.7

Verify that encrypted data is authenticated via signatures, authenticated cipher modes, or HMAC to ensure that ciphertext is not altered by an unauthorized party.

Level 1 required: False

Level 2 required: False

Level 3 required: True

CWE: [326](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/326)

## V6.2.8

Verify that all cryptographic operations are constant-time, with no 'short-circuit' operations in comparisons, calculations, or returns, to avoid leaking information.

Level 1 required: False

Level 2 required: False

Level 3 required: True

CWE: [385](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/385)
