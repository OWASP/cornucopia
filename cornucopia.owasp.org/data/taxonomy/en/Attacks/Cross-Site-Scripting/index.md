# Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) is a web security vulnerability where attackers inject malicious scripts into web pages. This could happen when the user input isn't properly validated, allowing scripts, often in JavaScript, to execute in other users' browsers. This can lead to unauthorized access, data theft, or other malicious activities.

## Example
Yahoo suffered from an XSS attack that affected its advertising network. Attackers were able to inject malicious code into Yahoo ads, leading to the distribution of malware to users who viewed the compromised ads.
