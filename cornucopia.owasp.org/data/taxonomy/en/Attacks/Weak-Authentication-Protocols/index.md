# Weak Authentication Protocols
Weak authentication protocols refer to security mechanisms that inadequately verify the identity of users or systems. These protocols often entail vulnerabilities, such as easily guessable passwords, insufficiently encrypted credentials, or ineffective multifactor authentication processes. These shortcomings render the authentication process susceptible to exploitation by malicious actors, potentially leading to unauthorized access and compromise of sensitive information.

## Example
Heartbleed, a serious vulnerability discovered in the OpenSSL cryptographic software library in 2014, allowed attackers to access sensitive information, including usernames and passwords, from websites using the affected versions of OpenSSL.
