# Weakening Encryption
Weakening encryption attacks involve efforts to compromise the effectiveness of encryption, usually through exploiting vulnerabilities or introducing backdoors.

## Example
infiltrates a popular messaging platform's development environment. Through social engineering and exploiting zero-day vulnerabilities, they introduce subtle flaws into the encryption protocols. This compromise allows them to covertly intercept sensitive communications without detection. The breach remains undetected for an extended period, posing a significant challenge to the security community as they scramble to identify and patch the concealed weaknesses, aiming to restore the platform's integrity and protect against further unauthorized access.
