# Replay attacks
A replay attack refers to the unauthorized duplication or delayed retransmission of legitimate data transmissions. This method involves the interception of critical data, such as authentication credentials, followed by the subsequent reuse of said data to illicitly access a targeted system or network.

## Example
Honda vehicles are reportedly vulnerable to the Rolling PWN attack, allowing remote access to open doors or start the engine. All ten tested Honda models were found to be affected. The attack involves replaying valid codes, exploiting a flaw in the rolling code implementation. Despite informing Honda weeks ago, there has been no response, as the company lacks a dedicated security department. This is the second such vulnerability found in Honda cars this year, emphasizing the need for improved security measures.
