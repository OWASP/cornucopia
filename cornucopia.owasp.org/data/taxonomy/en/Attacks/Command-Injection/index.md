# Command Injection
Command injection is a security flaw that occurs when an application allows untrusted user input to be included in system commands. Attackers exploit this vulnerability to execute unauthorized commands on the underlying operating system. This can cause unauthorized access, data exfiltration, Denial of service, Malware injection,â€¦

## Example
Shellshock was a series of security vulnerabilities discovered in the Bash shell, a widely used command-line interface in Unix-based operating systems. The vulnerability allowed attackers to execute arbitrary commands by injecting malicious code into environment variables. This had widespread implications, as many web servers, CGI scripts, and other systems were affected.
