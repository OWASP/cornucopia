# Manipulation of Hash Functions
Hash function manipulation involves exploiting vulnerabilities in hash functions, such as collision attacks, preimage attacks, chosen prefix collisionsâ€¦. These manipulations can compromise the integrity and security of systems relying on hash functions.

## Example
Over years, a significant number of cryptographic hash functions have been broken and proven to be vulnerable to security attacks. The main target of these attacks is the collision resistance of hash functions. For instance, in August 2004 collisions were found in several then-popular hash functions, including MD5
