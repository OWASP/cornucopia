# DOS attack
A Denial of Service (DoS) attack is a malicious attempt to disrupt the regular functioning of a system, service, or network by inundating it with a substantial volume of traffic. The objective is to overwhelm the targeted entity, rendering it inaccessible to legitimate users. This form of cyber threat aims to impair the availability and responsiveness of the targeted system, often causing disruption and inconvenience.

## Example
a website focused on the Royal Family was briefly taken down in a cyber attack claimed by the Killnet threat group. Known for targeting government sites, the group cited no specific motive but previously expressed dissatisfaction with UK support for Ukraine. The Royal Family has affirmed its backing for Ukraine, with King Charles III emphasizing solidarity. The outage lasted an hour, and the group posted proof on Telegram with the caption \"attack on pedophiles,\" though the connection to the Royal Family's support for Ukraine remains unclear.
