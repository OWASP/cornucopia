# Encryption Bypass
Encryption bypass refers to attempting to circumvent or break through the security measures of encrypted data.

## Example
security specialist Zara confronts a challenge in bypassing a company's robust encryption system. Recognizing a weakness in the encryption protocol, she exploits a flaw in the implementation's key exchange mechanism. Through careful analysis and reverse engineering, Zara identifies a subtle vulnerability that allows her to intercept and manipulate the encryption keys, ultimately gaining unauthorized access to the protected data.
