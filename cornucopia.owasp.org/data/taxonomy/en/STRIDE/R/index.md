# Repudiation

That a program is vulnerable to repudiation means that a user can deny their actions because the system lacks sufficient non-repudiation controls, like reliable logs. This allows individuals (or attackers) to deny performing a malicious or unauthorized action, such as a transaction, making it difficult to prove who is accountable. To mitigate this threat, robust logging and auditing mechanisms are essential to provide evidence of user activities and enforce accountability.

> An attacker manipulates logs to cover their actions.
