# Elevation of Privilege

Elevation of Privilege (EoP) is a security threat where a user or process gains unauthorized higher-level access or permissions within a system. An attacker exploits a vulnerability to perform actions, access data, or execute commands beyond their legitimate privileges, leading to a compromised system integrity. This threat is mitigated by implementing strong authorization controls to restrict access to only necessary functions and data.
