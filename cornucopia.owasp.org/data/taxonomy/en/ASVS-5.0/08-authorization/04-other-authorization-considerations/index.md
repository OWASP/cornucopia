#  Other Authorization Considerations
## V8.4.1

Verify that multi-tenant applications use cross-tenant controls to ensure consumer operations will never affect tenants with which they do not have permissions to interact.

Required for Level 2 and 3

## V8.4.2

Verify that access to administrative interfaces incorporates multiple layers of security, including continuous consumer identity verification, device security posture assessment, and contextual risk analysis, ensuring that network location or trusted endpoints are not the sole factors for authorization even though they may reduce the likelihood of unauthorized access.

Required for Level 3
