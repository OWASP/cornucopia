# OAuth Authorization Server

## V10.4.1

Verify that the authorization server validates redirect URIs based on a client-specific allowlist of pre-registered URIs using exact string comparison.

Required for Level 1, 2 and 3

## V10.4.2

Verify that, if the authorization server returns the authorization code in the authorization response, it can be used only once for a token request. For the second valid request with an authorization code that has already been used to issue an access token, the authorization server must reject a token request and revoke any issued tokens related to the authorization code.

Required for Level 1, 2 and 3

## V10.4.3

Verify that the authorization code is short-lived. The maximum lifetime can be up to 10 minutes for L1 and L2 applications and up to 1 minute for L3 applications.

Required for Level 1, 2 and 3

## V10.4.4

Verify that for a given client, the authorization server only allows the usage of grants that this client needs to use. Note that the grants 'token' (Implicit flow) and 'password' (Resource Owner Password Credentials flow) must no longer be used.

Required for Level 1, 2 and 3

## V10.4.5

Verify that the authorization server mitigates refresh token replay attacks for public clients, preferably using sender-constrained refresh tokens, i.e., Demonstrating Proof of Possession (DPoP) or Certificate-Bound Access Tokens using mutual TLS (mTLS). For L1 and L2 applications, refresh token rotation may be used. If refresh token rotation is used, the authorization server must invalidate the refresh token after usage, and revoke all refresh tokens for that authorization if an already used and invalidated refresh token is provided.

Required for Level 1, 2 and 3

## V10.4.6

Verify that, if the code grant is used, the authorization server mitigates authorization code interception attacks by requiring proof key for code exchange (PKCE). For authorization requests, the authorization server must require a valid 'code_challenge' value and must not accept a 'code_challenge_method' value of 'plain'. For a token request, it must require validation of the 'code_verifier' parameter.

Required for Level 2 and 3

## V10.4.7

Verify that if the authorization server supports unauthenticated dynamic client registration, it mitigates the risk of malicious client applications. It must validate client metadata such as any registered URIs, ensure the user's consent, and warn the user before processing an authorization request with an untrusted client application.

Required for Level 2 and 3

## V10.4.8

Verify that refresh tokens have an absolute expiration, including if sliding refresh token expiration is applied.

Required for Level 2 and 3

## V10.4.9

Verify that refresh tokens and reference access tokens can be revoked by an authorized user using the authorization server user interface, to mitigate the risk of malicious clients or stolen tokens.

Required for Level 2 and 3

## V10.4.10

Verify that confidential client is authenticated for client-to-authorized server backchannel requests such as token requests, pushed authorization requests (PAR), and token revocation requests.

Required for Level 2 and 3

## V10.4.11

Verify that the authorization server configuration only assigns the required scopes to the OAuth client.

Required for Level 2 and 3

## V10.4.12

Verify that for a given client, the authorization server only allows the 'response_mode' value that this client needs to use. For example, by having the authorization server validate this value against the expected values or by using pushed authorization request (PAR) or JWT-secured Authorization Request (JAR).

Required for Level 3

## V10.4.13

Verify that grant type 'code' is always used together with pushed authorization requests (PAR).

Required for Level 3

## V10.4.14

Verify that the authorization server issues only sender-constrained (Proof-of-Possession) access tokens, either with certificate-bound access tokens using mutual TLS (mTLS) or DPoP-bound access tokens (Demonstration of Proof of Possession).

Required for Level 3

## V10.4.15

Verify that, for a server-side client (which is not executed on the end-user device), the authorization server ensures that the 'authorization_details' parameter value is from the client backend and that the user has not tampered with it. For example, by requiring the usage of pushed authorization request (PAR) or JWT-secured Authorization Request (JAR).

Required for Level 3

## V10.4.16

Verify that the client is confidential and the authorization server requires the use of strong client authentication methods (based on public-key cryptography and resistant to replay attacks), such as mutual TLS ('tls_client_auth', 'self_signed_tls_client_auth') or private key JWT ('private_key_jwt').

Required for Level 3
