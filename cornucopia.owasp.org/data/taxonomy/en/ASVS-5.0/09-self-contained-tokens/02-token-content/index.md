#  Token content
## V9.2.1
Verify that, if a validity time span is present in the token data, the token and its content are accepted only if the verification time is within this validity time span. For example, for JWTs, the claims 'nbf' and 'exp' must be verified.
Required for Level 1, 2 and 3
## V9.2.2
Verify that the service receiving a token validates the token to be the correct type and is meant for the intended purpose before accepting the token's contents. For example, only access tokens can be accepted for authorization decisions and only ID Tokens can be used for proving user authentication.
Required for Level 2 and 3
## V9.2.3
Verify that the service only accepts tokens which are intended for use with that service (audience). For JWTs, this can be achieved by validating the 'aud' claim against an allowlist defined in the service.
Required for Level 2 and 3
## V9.2.4
Verify that, if a token issuer uses the same private key for issuing tokens to different audiences, the issued tokens contain an audience restriction that uniquely identifies the intended audiences. This will prevent a token from being reused with an unintended audience. If the audience identifier is dynamically provisioned, the token issuer must validate these audiences in order to make sure that they do not result in audience impersonation.
Required for Level 2 and 3
