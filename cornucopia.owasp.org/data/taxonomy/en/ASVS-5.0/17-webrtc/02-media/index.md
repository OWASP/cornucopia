#  Media
## V17.2.1
Verify that the key for the Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) certificate is managed and protected based on the documented policy for management of cryptographic keys.
Required for Level 2 and 3
## V17.2.2
Verify that the media server is configured to use and support approved Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) cipher suites and a secure protection profile for the DTLS Extension for establishing keys for the Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (DTLS-SRTP).
Required for Level 2 and 3
## V17.2.3
Verify that Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP) authentication is checked at the media server to prevent Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) injection attacks from leading to either a Denial of Service condition or audio or video media insertion into media streams.
Required for Level 2 and 3
## V17.2.4
Verify that the media server is able to continue processing incoming media traffic when encountering malformed Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP) packets.
Required for Level 2 and 3
## V17.2.5
Verify that the media server is able to continue processing incoming media traffic during a flood of Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP) packets from legitimate users.
Required for Level 3
## V17.2.6
Verify that the media server is not susceptible to the "ClientHello" Race Condition vulnerability in Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) by checking if the media server is publicly known to be vulnerable or by performing the race condition test.
Required for Level 3
## V17.2.7
Verify that any audio or video recording mechanisms associated with the media server are able to continue processing incoming media traffic during a flood of Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP) packets from legitimate users.
Required for Level 3
## V17.2.8
Verify that the Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) certificate is checked against the Session Description Protocol (SDP) fingerprint attribute, terminating the media stream if the check fails, to ensure the authenticity of the media stream.
Required for Level 3
