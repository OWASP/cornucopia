# CAPEC™ 255: Manipulate Data Structures

## Description

Attack patterns in this category manipulate and exploit characteristics of system data structures in order to violate the intended usage and protections of these structures. This is done in such a way that yields either improper access to the associated system data or violations of the security properties of the system itself due to vulnerabilities in how the system processes and manages the data structures. Often, vulnerabilities and therefore exploitability of these data structures exist due to ambiguity and assumption in their design and prescribed handling.
