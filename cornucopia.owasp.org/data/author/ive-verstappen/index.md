# Ive Verstappen
As the founder of [dotNET lab](https://www.dotnetlab.eu/), I am blessed to be able to work with world-class people, all of whom I respect and admire. I'm also pleased to have great, understanding customers from whom I learn a great deal about building a trustworthy business. Every day is a learning-experience for me.

We are extremely pleased to have a first-class team of consultants at [dotNET lab](https://www.dotnetlab.eu/). Our consultants are professionals and excellent developers. Besides being professional, they are also nice, interesting people with whom I enjoy spending my time. 

I find the world of Business and IT endlessly interesting and I really enjoy the process of trying to create a company where great people like to work.
