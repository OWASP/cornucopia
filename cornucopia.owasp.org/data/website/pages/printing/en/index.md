# Printing

The primary source document is a Word document. You can find it named under [owasp_cornucopia_webapp_n.nn_guide_bridge_(lang).docx](https://github.com/OWASP/cornucopia/releases/tag/v2.5.10 'OWASP Cornucopia on Github [external]') as part of the latest release.

Pre-printed card decks may, however, be more useful. To get this, click on [webshop](/webshop) in the upper right corner.

There are links to the source design files for the cards themselves on this page so that you can print them out yourself with your own design if you want to.

You can also choose to play the OWASP Cornucopia Website App Edition and Mobile App Edition online at [copi.owasp.org](https://copi.owasp.org 'The online version of OWASP Cornucopia [internal]').

## Printing instructions

The latest printable files are released under the [pre-release](https://github.com/OWASP/cornucopia/releases/tag/pre-release). Please download final printable files from there to ensure you get the latest updates and fixes done to the decks.

The docx/pdf files can be easily printed by any desktop printer, but for the best quality use the idml InDesign files. When sending the files to a printing facility you may have to supply the fonts that has been used in order to create the work.

In case the printing facility doesn't have the fonts at hand you'll find the installable fonts under `resources/templates/Fonts` in [owasp/cornucopia](https://github.com/owasp/cornucopia) repository. They are both open source and free for commercial use.

### The following fonts are used:
- Leaflet: Noto Sans (Light/Regular/Italic/Medium (Italic)/SemiBoldItalic/Extra Bold)
- Leaflet: Noto Sans (Thin/Light (Italic)/Italic/Medium//Extra Bold)
- Cases:
    - Noto Sans Condensed Bold

    - Noto Sans ExtraCondensed Extra Medium
- Logos:

### Dimensions

#### Card decks:

The "bridge" files are  (2.25 x 3.5" or 57mm x 88.8mm) standard playing cards.

The "tarot" files are (2.75 x 4.75" or 71mm x 121 mm) standard playing cards.

#### Cases:

the boxes has standard dimensions used by Agile Stationary to print their OWASP Cornucopia decks.

The "bridge" is 60 x 89.25 mm x 27.15 mm

The "tarot" is 122.2 x 73.1 x 29.1 mm

#### Leaflets:

The "bridge" and "tarot" version is a 16-20 page spread depending on which language you print it in.

The "bridge" files are  55mm x 87mm

The "tarot" files are (2.75 x 4.75")

Please be aware, that the table of content for the Indesign leaflet has to be adjusted for all language versions before printing except for the English version!!

This is because Indesign does not support auto adjusting the TOC.

You may need to adjust the font size to fit either a 16 or a 20 page leaflet spread.

DO NOT PRINT an 18 Page leaflet! It won't look good.

#### Blead:

A standard blead set to 3mm for all 4 sides.

#### Paper:

Use 300gsm for both the bridge cards and the tarot cards.

For the case, we would recommend folding box board with anti-scuff lamination and 100gsm uncoated stock for the leaflet. The leaflets could also be laminated, but it might make them springy.
