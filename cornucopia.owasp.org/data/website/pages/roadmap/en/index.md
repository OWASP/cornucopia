## Getting Involved

Involvement in the development and promotion of Cornucopia is actively encouraged! You do not have to be a security expert in order to contribute. Some of the ways you can help are listed below.

### Localization

Are you fluent in another language? Can you help translate Cornucopia into that language? Note this is a very large task due to the number of documents involved, but the strings are now all available in textual data files.

### Use and Promote the Cornucopia Card Decks

Please help raise awareness of Cornucopia by:


- Printing decks of cards and giving them away
- Using Cornucopia with specifiers, architects, designers, developers, testers and others, in part to train them, but also to solicit feedback on their usability, practicality and appropriateness for their work
- Creating videos about how to play the game
- Developing a mobile app to play the game


### Feedback

Please use the friendly project [Google Group](https://groups.google.com/a/owasp.org/forum/#!forum/cornucopia-project 'OWASP Cornucopia google mailing list [external]') for feedback:

- What do you like?
- What don’t you like?
- What cards don’t make sense?
- How could the guidance be improved?
- What other decks would you like to see?

### Keep the Cards Updated

As the source referenced documents change, we have to update the decks. You may also find errors and omissions. In the first instance, please send a message to the project’s [Google Group](https://groups.google.com/a/owasp.org/forum/#!forum/cornucopia-project 'OWASP Cornucopia google mailing list [external]') if you have identified errors &amp; omissions, have some time to maintain the source documents, or can help in other ways.

### Create a New Deck

The first deck, Cornucopia Ecommerce Website Edition, has been renamed Cornucopia Website App Edition and is currently available in six languages. There is also a mobile app specific deck called Cornucopia Mobile App Edition available in English only. Do you have an idea for your own application security requirements card deck?
