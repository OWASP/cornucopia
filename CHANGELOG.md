Updated templates with tags.
convert.py script pulls language files data and replaces tags with language text.
Functions available to output idml files or docx files.

Script can also create template files using the matching text to populate with tags.

Add meta data to the processing for editions, languages and versions.
Add logging.
Add testing.
