        <p>As the source referenced documents change, we have to update the decks. You may also find errors and omissions.

        <h3 id="create-a-new-deck">Create a New Deck</h3>
        
        <p>The first deck, Cornucopia Ecommerce Website Edition, has been renamed Cornucopia Website App Edition and is currently available in six languages. There is also a mobile app specific deck called Cornucopia Mobile App Edition available in English only. Do you have an idea for your own application security requirements card deck?</p>
