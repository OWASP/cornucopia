# Source code

There are a large number of source design files for the cards themselves in various languages and formats. These design files together with the source code to generate the Word document, PDFs and InDesign files for printing are maintained in our [Github repository](https://github.com/OWASP/cornucopia/releases/tag/v2.0.0).

One of the main advantages of the OWASP Cornucopia card game being open source is that it allows anyone to access and use the game without any licensing fees or restrictions. This encourages widespread adoption and makes it easier for teams to integrate the game into their security practices. Additionally, being open source means that the game is transparent and customizable. Teams can modify the game to suit their specific needs and address the security threats that are most relevant to their applications. They can also contribute back to the game's development by submitting new cards or improvements. Furthermore, open source software tends to have a large and active community of developers who contribute to the codebase and offer support. This can lead to faster bug fixes and updates, ensuring that the game remains relevant and effective in identifying security threats.
