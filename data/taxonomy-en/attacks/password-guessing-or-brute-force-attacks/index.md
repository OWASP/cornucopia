# Password Guessing/Brute Force Attacks
Password guessing, or brute force attacks, are techniques used by malicious actors to gain unauthorized access to a system or an account by systematically trying all possible combinations of passwords until the correct one is found. It's like a digital version of trying every key in the keyhole until the door opens.

## Example
In 2014, a cyber attack on Sony Pictures involved brute force attacks on employee passwords. The attackers successfully gained access to sensitive data by repeatedly attempting to guess passwords.
