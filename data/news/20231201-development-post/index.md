# This post is only here for development purpose
This post is not published. 
It is only here to display all features a single blogpost can have.

## This is a white title
Underneath this smaller title we will talk a bit about bullet points.
Each point represents an item in a list. 
- The first point
- Don't forget the second point
- This is the third point

### This is a green title 
Just as above, we have a bit of paragraph text underneath the green title.
I'm writing some more text as a  placeholder.
This is a link to [our website](https://www.dotnetlab.eu)

When I leave a single empty line in the markdown source file, I start a new paragraph.
Underneath this paragraph I'm showing a picture. The picture is stored next to the index.md source file.

## Bold and italic text
We have to option to make text **bold** or *italic* by using the '*' symbol.

Now let's imagine that we want to show the same image, but a bit smaller.
We can do this by adding the tag [medium] to the caption text of our image.

We can go even a step further, and make the image smaller! We do this by adding the [small] tag to our image caption.
