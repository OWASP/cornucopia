# Session Timeout Issues
A session timeout exploit involves manipulating or bypassing the session timeout mechanism in web applications, allowing unauthorized access to user accounts after the legitimate user has been logged out.

## Example
In a session timeout exploit, an attacker manipulates a captured session token, extending its expiration to maintain access beyond the intended timeout period. This unethical act involves altering the token's properties to bypass automatic logouts due to user inactivity. Note that this example is for educational purposes, and secure web applications implement measures to prevent such exploits.
