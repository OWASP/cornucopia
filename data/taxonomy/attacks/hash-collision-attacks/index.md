# Hash Collision Attacks
A hash collision occurs when two different inputs produce the same hash value. Hash collision attacks aim to find such inputs, and they can have security implications in various applications that rely on hash functions. One common example involves cryptographic hash functions.

## Example
Security specialist Ethan faces the challenge of compromising a company's robust hashing system. Recognizing a weakness in the hashing protocol, she exploits a flaw in collision resistance. Through careful analysis, Ethan identifies a subtle vulnerability, enabling her to engineer a hash collision. This manipulation grants unauthorized access to the system, highlighting the importance of addressing collision resistance in hash functions.
