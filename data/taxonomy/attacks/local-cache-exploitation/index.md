# Local Cache exploitation
Local cache exploitation involves manipulating or unauthorized access to cached data on a device or local network, potentially compromising sensitive information. Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in caching mechanisms, such as cache poisoning or snooping, to compromise system security.

## Example
Meltdown is a security vulnerability in processors that use speculative execution. Exploiting it enables attackers to force the processor to load sensitive kernel memory into the cache, potentially exposing confidential data like passwords. Primarily affecting Intel processors, the flaw was disclosed in 2018, prompting rapid deployment of patches for operating systems and microcode updates from processor manufacturers to mitigate the risk.
