# File Upload Vulnerabilities
File upload vulnerabilities occur when websites or applications allow users to upload files without adequate security measures. Attackers exploit these weaknesses to upload malicious files, potentially leading to issues like remote code execution, bypassing file type restrictions, content-type manipulation, file overwriting, or denial of service attacks.

## Example
A critical vulnerability in the Forminator WordPress Contact Form plugin, affecting over 400,000 websites, allows unauthenticated attackers to upload malicious files, potentially leading to remote code execution. The issue has been patched in version 1.25.0, and users are urged to update immediately for security. The vulnerability highlights the need to secure contact forms, and the Forminator changelog should provide information on the patch.
