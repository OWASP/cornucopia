# Session Hijacking (Man-in-the-Middle)
Session hijacking, or man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack, is a security breach where an unauthorized party intercepts and possibly alters communication between a user and a server. This allows the attacker to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information, such as login credentials or session tokens, potentially leading to impersonation and unauthorized account access.

## Example
Lenovo faced backlash in 2015 when it was revealed that some of its laptops were pre-installed with adware called Superfish. Superfish used a self-signed root certificate to intercept and inspect encrypted connections, potentially leaving users vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks. The presence of this adware not only raised serious security concerns but also led to a loss of trust in Lenovo's products.
