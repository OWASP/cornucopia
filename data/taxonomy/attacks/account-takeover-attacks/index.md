# Account Takeover (ATO) Attacks
Account Takeover (ATO) attacks involve unauthorized access to online accounts through methods like phishing or malware. Once infiltrated, malicious actors exploit compromised accounts for identity theft, financial fraud, or other illicit activities. To counter ATO risks, it is imperative to employ stringent security measures, including strong, unique passwords, the implementation of multi-factor authentication, and a heightened awareness of phishing attempts.

## Example
LinkedIn experienced a security breach in 2012 where attackers used compromised passwords to gain unauthorized access to user accounts. This incident highlighted the importance of strong, unique passwords for online accounts.
