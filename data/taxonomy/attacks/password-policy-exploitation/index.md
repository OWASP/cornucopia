# Password Policy Exploitation
Password policy exploitation involves taking advantage of weaknesses in an organization's password rules to gain unauthorized access. Tactics include brute force attacks, password spraying, and credential stuffing. Mitigation strategies include enforcing strong passwords, implementing multi-factor authentication, and educating users on password security.


## Example
LinkedIn experienced a security breach in 2012 where attackers used compromised passwords to gain unauthorized access to user accounts. This incident highlighted the importance of strong, unique passwords for online accounts.
