# Privilege escalation
Privilege escalation refers to the process by which an attacker or an unauthorized user gains higher-level access or permissions than they are initially granted. This can occur in various systems, such as operating systems, databases, or applications.

## Example
In June 2022, a privilege escalation vulnerability in MikroTik RouterOS was disclosed at REcon, affecting x86 Virtual Machines. The vulnerability allowed obtaining a root shell, with new exploits targeting a broader range of hardware. MikroTik addressed the issue with patches in version 6.49.7. The vulnerability (CVE-2023-30799) allowed threat actors to escalate from admin to super-admin, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution. Over 900K routers were reported as vulnerable.
