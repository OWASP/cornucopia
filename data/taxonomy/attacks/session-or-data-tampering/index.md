# (Session) Data tampering
Data tampering refers to the unauthorized or intentional alteration of data. It involves modifying, deleting, or adding information to manipulate the integrity and accuracy of data. This can occur in various contexts, such as computer systems, databases, financial records, or any other digital storage medium. It can lead to misinformation, security breaches, and compromised decision-making processes.

## Example
In 2017, Equifax, one of the largest credit reporting agencies, suffered a massive data breach that exposed sensitive personal information of 147 million people. The attackers exploited a vulnerability in the Apache Struts framework, which Equifax failed to patch in a timely manner. The unauthorized access was a result of the company's failure to adequately authorize and secure its systems.
