# Social engineering attack
Social engineering attacks involve manipulating individuals through deception to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information or systems. These tactics rely on psychological manipulation, impersonation, and deceit to trick people into compromising security.

## Example
Caesar's Entertainment and MGM, two major casino operators, fell victim to cyber attacks, with Caesar's experiencing a social engineering attack on an IT vendor and MGM facing a ransomware attack. The group Scattered Spider is linked to both incidents. A spokesperson for Scattered Spider claimed responsibility for the MGM attack, citing LinkedIn information to manipulate an IT vendor employee. The rise in sophisticated social engineering attacks emphasizes the need for increased cybersecurity training and protocols for both businesses and individuals to mitigate risks.
