# Insider Threats
Insider threat in cybersecurity refers to the potential risk posed by individuals within an organization who may intentionally or unintentionally compromise security, often due to their access to sensitive information and systems.

## Example
In 2019 Microsoft employees made misconfiguration errors on a new version of Azure security rules. They were lax about monitoring user records and activity with sensitive assets. In addition, they didnâ€™t limit access to a customer support database with a strong password or two-factor authentication.
