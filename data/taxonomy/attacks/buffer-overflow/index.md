# Buffer Overflow
A buffer overflow attack occurs when a program writes more data to a designated storage area (buffer) than it can handle, leading to data overflow into adjacent memory. This can be exploited by attackers to execute malicious code or compromise system integrity.

## Example
Equifax data breach in 2017 was caused by a vulnerability in the Apache Struts web application framework. The specific issue was a remote code execution vulnerability resulting from improper validation of user-supplied input. Attackers were able to exploit this vulnerability through a crafted request, triggering a buffer overflow and allowing them to execute arbitrary code on the affected servers.
