### Scenario: Grant’s Exploitation for Denial of Service 
Imagine a scenario where Grant utilizes an application to deny service to some or all of its users. This occurs due to: 

1. **Vulnerabilities to Overload:** The application has weaknesses that can be exploited to overload its resources, such as server bandwidth or processing capacity. 

2. **Inadequate Rate Limiting:** The lack of controls on the frequency and volume of user requests allows Gareth to send an overwhelming number of requests, leading to service disruptions. 

3. **Exploitable Functionalities:** Certain features of the application can be misused to create bottlenecks or consume disproportionate resources. 

### Example: 

Gareth targets an online retail platform. He identifies that the site’s search functionality is not rate-limited and requires intensive database queries. By sending rapid and numerous complex search requests, he overloads the server, causing significant slowdowns for other users and eventually leading to a denial of service. This exploitation effectively prevents legitimate users from accessing the website and making purchases. 

### Risks: 

Such vulnerabilities can lead to the application becoming unavailable or unresponsive, impacting user experience, and potentially causing financial and reputational damage to the service provider. 

### Mitigation: 

- Implement robust rate limiting on user requests, particularly for resource-intensive functionalities. 
- Monitor and optimize the application’s performance to handle high volumes of traffic and processing. 
- Regularly conduct stress tests to identify and address potential denial of service vulnerabilities. 
- Develop and maintain an incident response plan to quickly mitigate and recover from denial of service attacks.
