### Scenario: Susannaâ€™s Ability to Break Weak Cryptography 
Envision a scenario where Susanna, an attacker, manages to break the cryptographic protections in use because they are not sufficiently robust. This issue arises from: 

1. **Inadequate Strength for Required Protection:** The cryptography level does not match the sensitivity or importance of the data it is protecting. 

2. **Underestimation of Attacker Capabilities:** The cryptographic strength is not sufficient to withstand the efforts of determined attackers. 

### Example: 

Susanna targets an application storing highly sensitive user data, protected by outdated cryptographic algorithms. She dedicates significant resources to cracking these cryptographic protections. Due to the use of older, weaker cryptographic methods that no longer meet current security standards, Susanna successfully decrypts the data, accessing confidential information. The cryptography used was not strong enough to withstand the level of effort and resources she was willing to invest. 

### Risks: 

Using cryptography that is not sufficiently strong for the required level of protection can lead to data breaches, unauthorized access, and exposure of sensitive information. 

### Mitigation: 

- Assess the sensitivity and value of the data being protected and ensure the strength of the cryptographic measures is adequate to provide the necessary level of security. 
- Regularly update and upgrade cryptographic algorithms and practices to align with current security standards and to counteract evolving threats. 
- Monitor developments in cryptography and cybersecurity to anticipate and prepare for potential efforts by attackers.
