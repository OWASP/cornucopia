### Scenario: Justin's Access to Unencrypted Credentials 
Imagine a scenario where Justin accesses credentials for internal or external resources, services, and other systems because they are stored unencrypted or embedded in source code. This vulnerability arises due to: 

1. **Unencrypted Storage of Credentials:** Sensitive credentials are stored in plain text, making them easily accessible. 

2. **Credentials Embedded in Source Code:** Important credentials are hard-coded into the applicationâ€™s source code, posing a significant security risk. 

### Example: 

Justin examines the source code of a publicly accessible repository for a web application and discovers hard-coded credentials for accessing its database. Additionally, he finds that the application stores API keys for external services in unencrypted configuration files. Using these credentials, Justin gains unauthorized access to the application's database and external services, compromising both the application and its integrated systems. 

### Risks: 

Storing credentials in an unencrypted format or embedding them in source code can lead to unauthorized system access, data breaches, and potentially severe security incidents. 

### Mitigation: 

- Avoid storing credentials in the source code. Instead, use secure vaults or environment variables for credential storage. 
- Ensure all sensitive credentials are encrypted and securely managed, accessible only to authorized systems or personnel. 
- Regularly audit and update credential management practices to prevent unauthorized access and exposure.
