### Scenario: Kyle's Bypassing of Non-Secure Cryptographic Failures 
Envision a scenario where Kyle exploits cryptographic systems that default to an unprotected state when they fail. This vulnerability arises from: 

1. **Non-Secure Default in Failure Scenarios:** In case of a failure in the cryptographic process, the system defaults to allowing access or processing data without encryption, rather than ensuring protection. 

### Example: 

Kyle targets an application that handles sensitive data encryption. He observes that when thereâ€™s a failure in the encryption process, perhaps due to configuration errors or system issues, the application continues to process and transmit data in an unencrypted state. Exploiting this, Kyle induces failures in the cryptographic system, causing the application to revert to its non-secure default state. This allows him to access sensitive data that should have been encrypted. 

### Risks: 

Such a vulnerability can lead to data exposure and breaches, as it allows sensitive information to be processed or transmitted without the intended cryptographic protection. 

### Mitigation: 

- Design cryptographic systems to fail securely, ensuring that in the event of a failure, data remains protected or access is restricted. 
- Implement robust error handling that maintains security standards even when cryptographic processes encounter issues. 
- Regularly test and audit cryptographic systems to ensure they respond securely to failures and do not expose sensitive data.
