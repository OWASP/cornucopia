### Scenario: Johanâ€™s Authentication Bypass Across Various Functions and Channels 
Imagine a scenario where Johan bypasses authentication by exploiting inconsistencies in the enforcement of authentication processes. This happens because: 

1. **Varying Rigor in Authentication Functions:** Not all authentication-related functions, like registration, password change, recovery, logout, or administration, have the same level of security rigor. 

2. **Inconsistent Authentication Across Channels:** Different versions or channels of the system, such as mobile websites, apps, full websites, APIs, or call centers, do not uniformly enforce authentication standards. 

### Example: 

Jaime discovers that while the main website of a service enforces strong authentication, its mobile app version has weaker security checks, particularly for password recovery. Exploiting this, Jaime uses the mobile app to request a password reset for a user account. The app does not implement additional security measures, like sending a confirmation to the user's registered email or requiring answers to security questions, allowing Jaime easy unauthorized access. 

### Risks: 

Such inconsistencies can lead to unauthorized access and exploitation of authentication weaknesses, posing a significant risk to user data and system integrity. 

### Mitigation: 

- Ensure uniform implementation of robust authentication measures across all functionalities and channels, including mobile and web platforms, APIs, and customer service points. 
- Regularly review and update authentication protocols to maintain consistent security standards across all access points. 
- Conduct thorough testing and audits to identify and rectify any disparities in authentication enforcement.
