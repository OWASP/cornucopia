### Scenario: Javier’s Exploitation of Weak Credentials 
Picture a scenario where Javier gains unauthorized access by exploiting weak or overlooked aspects of credential management. He capitalizes on: 

1. **Default Credentials:** Using default usernames and passwords that haven’t been changed. 

2. **Test Accounts:** Accessing accounts created for testing, which are often less secure. 

3. **Guessable Credentials:** Exploiting simple or commonly used passwords. 

4. **Old Accounts:** Utilizing accounts that are no longer active but haven’t been properly deactivated. 

5. **Unnecessary Accounts:** Gaining access through accounts that exist but are not essential for the application's operation. 

### Example: 

Javier targets a company’s web application that still has accounts with default credentials, such as "admin/admin." These accounts, often overlooked or forgotten, provide an easy entry point. He uses these credentials to log in, gaining the same level of access as a legitimate administrator, which he then uses to access sensitive data and system controls. 

### Risks: 

Such vulnerabilities allow for unauthorized access and control, leading to potential data breaches, system manipulations, and other security risks. 

### Mitigation: 

- Ensure all default credentials are changed upon system setup or application installation. 
- Regularly audit accounts to identify and remove or secure test and unnecessary accounts. 
- Implement and enforce strong password policies, discouraging easily guessable passwords. 
- Routinely deactivate old accounts and monitor for any unauthorized access attempts.
