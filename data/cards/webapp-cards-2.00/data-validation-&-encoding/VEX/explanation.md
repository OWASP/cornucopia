### Scenario: Darío’s Deceptive Data Manipulation 
Imagine a scenario where Darío takes advantage of the application's trust in its data sources. He manipulates the system in several ways: 

1. **Exploiting User-Defined Data:** The application overly trusts data input by users. 

2. **Tampering with Client-Side Data:** The application fails to validate data altered on a client device. 

3. **Altering State Data on Client Devices:** The application doesn't verify the integrity of state data, like session tokens, stored on client devices. 

4. **Lack of Identity Verification:** The system inadequately verifies the identity of a user during data validation. 

### Example: 

Darío attacks by altering a session token stored in his browser's local storage. He changes the token's value to mimic that of another user, say, Colin. Since the application trusts this client-side data without additional verification, Darío gains access to Colin's account and privileges. This breach occurs because the system assumes the integrity and authenticity of locally stored data without adequately verifying it. 

### Risks: 

This kind of vulnerability can lead to identity theft, unauthorized access, and potentially severe data breaches. 

### Mitigation: 

- Implement strict validation of user-defined and client-side data. 
- Ensure strong verification of user identity and the integrity of state data stored on client devices. 
- Regularly review and strengthen security measures to guard against data manipulation.
