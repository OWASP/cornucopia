### Scenario: Casey's Exploitation of Inadequate Session Termination 
Imagine a situation where Casey takes advantage of a system’s flawed session termination process. This becomes possible because: 

1. **Absence of Log Out Function:** The system lacks a clear, accessible log out function. 

2. **Ineffective Log Out:** Even when users attempt to log out, the session is not properly terminated. 

3. **Complex Log Out Process:** The log out function is not easily accessible or user-friendly, leading to users inadvertently leaving sessions active. 

### Example: 

Casey targets a web application where users find it difficult to locate the log out button due to its obscure placement. Adam, a user of the application, believes he has exited the session, but in reality, the session remains active. Casey, seizing this opportunity, accesses the still-active session from Adam's device or a public computer Adam used, gaining unauthorized access to Adam’s account and sensitive information. 

### Risks: 

This flaw can lead to unauthorized session access and potential data breaches, as attackers exploit sessions that users believe to be safely closed. 

### Mitigation: 

- Ensure the log out function is clearly visible and easily accessible on all interfaces of the application. 
- Design the log out process to completely terminate the session on the server side, not just on the client device. 
- Conduct user experience testing to ensure the log out process is intuitive and effective.
