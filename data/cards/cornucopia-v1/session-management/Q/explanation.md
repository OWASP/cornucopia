### Scenario: Salim’s Bypass of Inconsistent Session Management 
Envision a situation where Salim takes advantage of an application’s inconsistent application of session management. This vulnerability arises because: 

1. **Inconsistent Application Across Features:** Different parts of the application implement session management with varying degrees of rigor. 

2. **Comprehensive Coverage Lacking:** Certain areas or functionalities of the application lack proper session management controls. 

### Example: 

Salim targets a multi-faceted web application that has robust session management for its main features, like user profiles and dashboards. However, he discovers that the newer modules, such as a recently added chat function, lack similar session controls. He exploits these less secure areas to gain unauthorized access, manipulating session tokens or hijacking sessions where the system’s oversight is most pronounced. 

### Risks: 

Inconsistencies in session management across an application can lead to unauthorized access and potential exploitation of the less secure areas, compromising overall system security. 

### Mitigation: 

- Ensure uniform implementation of session management controls across all areas and functionalities of the application. 
- Conduct thorough security reviews and testing, especially when integrating new features or modules, to ensure they meet established session management standards. 
- Regularly update and harmonize session management practices to maintain comprehensive and consistent security coverage.
