### Scenario: Matt’s Abuse of Long-Lasting Sessions 
Visualize a scenario where Matt exploits the lack of periodic re-authentication in an application. This issue arises because: 

1. **Prolonged Session Duration:** The application allows sessions to remain active for extended periods without re-verifying the user's identity or privileges. 

2. **No Checks for Privilege Changes:** The system does not reassess user privileges during long sessions, potentially missing changes in user status or permissions. 

### Example: 

Matt gains access to an employee’s account in a corporate system early in the day. Throughout the day, the employee’s access rights are revoked due to a change in their employment status. However, since the system does not require re-authentication or check for privilege changes during active sessions, Matt continues to have access to sensitive information and system functionalities all day, exploiting the unchanged session privileges. 

### Risks: 

This vulnerability can lead to unauthorized access and misuse of privileges, especially in cases where user privileges have been altered or revoked. 

### Mitigation: 

- Implement a system for periodic re-authentication, especially for sessions that last beyond a certain time threshold. 
- Regularly check and update user privileges within active sessions to ensure they reflect current permissions. 
- Consider introducing shorter session timeouts for highly sensitive applications, requiring users to re-authenticate more frequently.
