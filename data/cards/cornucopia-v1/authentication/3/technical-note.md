Passwords and secrets need protection. Common attacks include:

Stealing a password/secret in transit (e.g. in an email message, over an unencrypted HTTP connection)
Observing a password/secret being entered on screen
Weak password recovery (e.g. reliance only on 'security' questions)
Use of weak 'remember me' functionality
Re-use of passwords making them guessable
Passwords/secrets recorded in logs
Passwords/secrets exposed in form data/URLs
Client-side caching or storage of passwords/secrets
Hard-coding of passwords/secrets into code
Passwords never changed by user
