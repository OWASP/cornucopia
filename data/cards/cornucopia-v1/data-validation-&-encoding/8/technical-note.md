Sanitization may be used to strip some inputs or outputs of certain unwanted characters. It is not a substitute for data validation and encoding, but may be used in combination (e.g. to remove leading/trailing whitespace from keyboard input). If sanitization is part of the validation and encoding processes, ensure that no relevant input/output is excluded, or can be bypassed by submitting data through a different input stream (e.g. GET instead of POST) or using a different app (e.g. mobile vs. desktop).

NB: The key concept for this card is use of sanitization, and whether such routines are comprehensively applied.
