### Scenario: Dennis’s Control Over Validation and Encoding 
Picture a scenario where Dennis gains control over crucial aspects of the system’s security - specifically, input validation, output validation, and output encoding routines. This allows him to manipulate these processes: 

1. **Control Over Input Validation:** Dennis can manipulate or bypass checks on data entering the system. 

2. **Influence on Output Validation:** He has the ability to alter or disable validation of data before it's presented or used. 

3. **Manipulation of Output Encoding Routines:** Dennis can modify how data is encoded before it’s sent to users or other systems, potentially disabling vital security measures. 

### Example: 

Dennis exploits his control by disabling certain input validation checks on a form that accepts user data. For instance, he allows special characters or script inputs that are usually blocked. This enables him to insert malicious scripts or commands, which are then executed by the system or other users, leading to vulnerabilities like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) or command injections. 

### Risks: 

Such control over validation and encoding routines can lead to a wide array of security issues, including data corruption, unauthorized access, and execution of harmful scripts. 

### Mitigation: 

- Implement strict access controls and monitoring to prevent unauthorized changes to validation and encoding routines. 
- Regularly review and audit these processes to ensure they haven't been tampered with. 
- Establish robust checks and balances within the development and deployment processes to detect any unauthorized modifications.
