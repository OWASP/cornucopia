### Scenario: Eduardo's Unauthorized Data Access Within Authorized Areas 
Visualize a situation where Eduardo, despite having legitimate access to a certain form, page, URL, or entry point within an application, is able to access data beyond his authorized permissions. This happens due to: 

1. **Inadequate Granular Authorization Controls:** The application does not enforce sufficient authorization checks at the data level, despite having controls at the page or form level. 

2. **Access Control Oversights:** The system fails to differentiate between the authorization for accessing a page and the authorization for accessing specific data on that page. 

### Example: 

Eduardo has legitimate access to a report generation page in a corporate application. However, the pageâ€™s backend logic does not adequately verify his permissions for each data set available through the report generator. Eduardo exploits this oversight to access confidential data sets from the report generation tool, which he should not have access to based on his user role. 

### Risks: 

Such gaps in authorization controls can lead to unauthorized data access, potentially resulting in information leakage, privacy breaches, and compliance violations. 

### Mitigation: 

- Implement granular authorization checks that not only control access to pages and forms but also verify user permissions for each data set or action available within these entry points. 
- Regularly audit and update access control mechanisms to ensure they align with user roles and data sensitivity levels. 
- Conduct thorough security testing to identify and address any potential authorization bypass scenarios.
