### Scenario: Tomâ€™s Manipulation of Process Sequences and Control Data 
Imagine a scenario where Tom bypasses established business rules by altering the normal sequence or flow of processes within an application. He exploits system vulnerabilities such as: 

1. **Altering Process Sequence:** Tom changes the usual order of operations in a process. 

2. **Manipulating Date and Time Values:** He adjusts date and time values used by the application to circumvent restrictions or trigger unintended behaviors. 

3. **Misusing Valid Features:** Tom uses application features for purposes other than their intended use. 

4. **Manipulating Control Data:** He alters data that the application uses to control process flow or decision-making. 

### Example: 

Tom targets an online shopping platform where users are required to finalize their shopping cart before proceeding to checkout. However, by manipulating the URL parameters and submitting POST requests out of the intended sequence, he bypasses certain checks, adding items to the cart at discounted prices post-confirmation. He also adjusts the system's date and time parameters to access time-limited special offers. This manipulation allows Tom to exploit the application's features and control data for unintended benefits. 

### Risks: 

Such vulnerabilities can lead to process integrity breaches, unauthorized access to restricted functionalities, and potential financial losses or data inconsistencies. 

### Mitigation: 

- Design the system to strictly enforce the intended sequence and flow of processes. 
- Validate all control data, including date and time parameters, to ensure they have not been tampered with. 
- Limit the ability to manipulate URLs and direct requests that can alter the normal application flow. 
- Regularly review and test the application for potential misuse of features and control data manipulations.
