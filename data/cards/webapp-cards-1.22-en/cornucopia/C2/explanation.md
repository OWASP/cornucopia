### Scenario: Lee's Bypassing of Application Controls 
Imagine a scenario where Lee bypasses application controls due to various coding and implementation vulnerabilities. This situation arises from: 

1. **Use of Risky Programming Functions:** The application utilizes dangerous functions in its code instead of safer alternatives. 

2. **Type Conversion Errors:** Inaccurate or improper type conversions lead to vulnerabilities. 

3. **Dependency on External Resources:** The application’s reliability is compromised when external resources are unavailable. 

4. **Race Conditions:** Concurrent processes lead to conditions where the application’s behavior is unpredictable. 

5. **Resource Initialization or Allocation Issues:** Problems in initializing or allocating resources create vulnerabilities. 

6. **Potential for Overflows:** The application is susceptible to overflows, such as buffer overflows, due to inadequate handling. 

### Example: 

Lee discovers that a web application uses risky functions that are known to be vulnerable to injection attacks. He exploits these functions to manipulate the application’s behavior. Additionally, Lee takes advantage of type conversion errors to cause unexpected behaviors in the application. He also notices that the application fails to handle scenarios where an external API is down, using this to trigger a denial of service. Furthermore, Lee exploits a race condition by initiating simultaneous processes that alter the application’s intended flow, and he triggers a buffer overflow to execute arbitrary code. 

### Risks: 

Such vulnerabilities can lead to a range of issues, from unauthorized access and data breaches to complete system compromise. 

### Mitigation: 

- Replace risky functions with safer alternatives and follow secure coding practices. 
- Implement thorough error handling and validation for type conversions. 
- Design the application to handle unavailability or failures of external resources gracefully. 
- Address potential race conditions through proper synchronization and concurrency controls. 
- Ensure robust initialization and allocation of resources, and rigorously check for potential overflows. 
- Regularly audit and test the application for these vulnerabilities, and update practices as needed.
