### Scenario: Shamunâ€™s Validation Workaround 
Imagine a scenario where Shamun, exploiting a critical oversight, bypasses both input and output validation checks in a system. This is possible because the system does not adequately handle validation failures: 

1. **Non-Rejection of Validation Failures:** When input or output data fails validation, the system does not outright reject it. 

2. **Lack of Sanitization After Validation Failure:** The system fails to sanitize data that doesn't pass validation checks. 

### Example: 

Shamun discovers that when certain inputs fail validation checks on your website, instead of rejecting them, the system attempts to process them with minimal or no sanitization. He exploits this by submitting data that is purposefully malformed to fail validation, yet crafted in a way that, when processed, triggers unintended behavior or exposes sensitive information. 

### Risks: 

This vulnerability can lead to various security threats, including data leakage, unauthorized actions within the system, and the execution of malicious code. 

### Mitigation: 

- Implement a strict policy to reject any data that fails validation checks. 
- In cases where rejection is not possible, thoroughly sanitize all data post-validation failure. 
- Regularly update validation and sanitization procedures to address emerging security threats and ensure comprehensive coverage
