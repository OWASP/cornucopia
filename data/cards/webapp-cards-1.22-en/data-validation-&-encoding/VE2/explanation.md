### Scenario: Brian’s Discovery 
Imagine a situation where Brian, a potential intruder, learns about your system’s configurations, logic, and infrastructure. He does this through error messages or misconfigurations on your website. This can happen in several ways:

1. **Detailed Error Messages:** Error messages that inadvertently reveal software types, database structures, or even source code. 

2. **Default or Outdated Files:** The presence of unmodified default configurations or old, test, backup files left on the server. 

3. **Exposed Source Code:** Situations where the source code is accidentally made visible on the website. 

### Example 
Brian attacks by accessing a server error page that is poorly configured. Instead of a generic error message, it displays detailed database error information, including software versions and file paths. This error message becomes a treasure trove of information for Brian, allowing him to identify specific vulnerabilities for targeted attacks. 

### Risks 
This kind of information leakage can lead to targeted attacks, exploitation of system vulnerabilities, and significant security breaches. 

### Mitigation 
- Implement generic, non-revealing error messages. 
- Ensure system configurations are secure and default installation files are removed or updated. 
- Regularly audit and clean up any old, test, or backup files. 
- Keep source code strictly protected from public exposure.
