### Scenario: Axel's Data and Code Manipulation Due to Lack of Integrity Checks 
Envision a situation where Axel manipulates various types of data and code within a system, exploiting the absence of integrity checking. This lack of verification allows for: 

1. **Alteration of Data in Transit or Storage:** Axel can modify data being transmitted or stored, as there are no checks to validate data integrity. 

2. **Source Code Tampering:** The source code, including updates and patches, can be altered without detection. 

3. **Configuration Data Changes:** Axel can change configuration settings without triggering any alerts. 

### Example: 

Axel targets an application that does not implement integrity checks on its data transmissions. He intercepts data being sent to the server and modifies it, injecting malicious content or altering transaction details. Additionally, he tampers with source code updates before they are applied, introducing vulnerabilities into the system. The lack of integrity verification means these alterations go unnoticed and are executed as if legitimate. 

### Risks: 

Such vulnerabilities can lead to unauthorized data manipulation, introduction of malware, corrupted system updates, and compromised system functionality. 

### Mitigation: 

- Implement cryptographic hash functions and digital signatures to ensure data integrity for stored and in-transit data. 
- Apply integrity checks to source code, updates, patches, and configuration data, verifying their authenticity before acceptance and execution. 
- Regularly audit and update security protocols to maintain effective protection against data and code tampering.
